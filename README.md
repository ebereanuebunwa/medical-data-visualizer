#### My third task - **Data Analysis With Python** on **FreeCodeCamp** 

This task focused more on visualzation with `Seaborn`.
I had to go back and read a little more on categorical variables and plots.
Also read a few on `Correlation matrices` and how they are used in plotting `heatmaps`.

The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. The aim of this task is to use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.
